    <h2>Program</h2>
    <p>This lecture series consists of <b>2 parts</b> , 
        these being: the <b>introductory lectures</b> and the <b>seminars</b>. 
            During the first part we'll have 1-2 introductory lectures per week, where we 
            will teach the basics of category theory with a focus on applications to Machine Learning.  
            <br>The seminars will be deep dives into specific topics of Category Theory,
            some already showing applications to Machine Learning and some which have
            not beeen applied yet.
            <br>Also, during both parts we'll have discussions and extra activities in our Zulip stream!
    </p>

                    Gal's research interests revolve around investigating the mysteries of Deep Learning---why and how overparameterized models generalize, what are the failure modes of Deep Networks, how can we make models robust to distribution shift and adversarial examples. At the moment, Gal is exploring the theory behind the emergent area of self-supervised learning, in particular, what is the driving mechanism behind contrastive learning

                    <b>Bio:</b> Why do large learning rates often produce better results? Why do “infinitely wide” networks trained using kernel methods tend to underperform ordinary networks? In the talk I will argue that these questions are related. Existing kernel-based theory can explain the dynamics of networks trained with small learning rates. However, optimal performance is often achieved at large learning rates, where we find qualitatively different dynamics that converge to flat minima. The distinction between the small and large learning rate phases becomes sharp at infinite width, and is reminiscent of nonperturbative phase transitions that appear in physical systems.

                A supervised learning algorithm searches over a set of functions \(A→B\) parametrised by a space \(P\) to find the best approximation to some ideal function \(f:A→B\). It does this by taking examples \((a,f(a))∈A×B\), and updating the parameter according to some rule. We define a category where these update rules may be composed, and show that gradient descent --- with respect to a fixed step size and an error function satisfying a certain property --- defines a monoidal functor from a category of parametrised functions to this category of update rules. This provides a structural perspective on backpropagation, as well as a broad generalisation of neural networks.

                CycleGAN is a general approach to unpaired image-to-image translation that has been getting attention in recent years. Inspired by categorical database systems, we show that CycleGAN is a "schema", i.e. a specific category presented by generators and relations, whose specific parameter instantiations are just set-valued functors on this schema. We show that enforcing cycle-consistencies amounts to enforcing composition invariants in this category. We generalize the learning procedure to arbitrary such categories and show that a special class of functors, rather than functions, can be learned using gradient descent. Using this framework we design a novel neural network system capable of learning to insert and delete objects from images without paired data. We qualitatively evaluate the system on three different datasets and obtain promising results.
